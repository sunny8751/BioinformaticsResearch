n = # of features
Ranking: 
1. ranked every feature weight from 1-n with 1 being the highest weight.
2. took out not significant features by filtering out all features with weights less than cutoff.
3. weight cutoff determined by plotting each weight in density graph with feature weights on one side and frequency on other side.
Took mean (around 0 theoretically) and std dev. So, filter out features with weights of mean +- sd on both sides
4. Found absolute value of difference of both weights of same feature and put in descending order
5. Plot on scatter plot with both feature weights on axes
