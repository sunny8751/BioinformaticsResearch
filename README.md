# LIBSVR
Used the LIBSVM project (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) and edited the program to use for my research at Duke University on the comparison of transcription factors E2F1 and E2F4's binding to DNA sequences. This program creates models that predict the likelihood of E2F1 and E2F4 binding to the inputted DNA sequence, and then analyzes the models to find differences in the binding specificities of the two DNA sequences.
