# LIBSVR
Used the LIBSVM project (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) and edited the program to use for my research at Duke University on the comparison of transcription factors E2F1 and E2F4's binding to DNA sequences. This program creates models that predict the likelihood of E2F1 and E2F4 binding to the inputted DNA sequence, and then analyzes the models to find differences in the binding specificities of the two DNA sequences.

An in-depth explanation of the research project is in "Research Paper.pdf" inside the "Papers and Presentations" folder. The documentation for the project is also in this folder.

The "Raw Data" folder contains the original gcPBM raw data that I worked with. The entire project used this raw data and the publically available LIBSVM.

The "src" folder contains the Java files that I modified from the original LIBSVM.

By analyzing and comparing the data, I produced the following images. A complete set of the images is available in the "Images" folder.
